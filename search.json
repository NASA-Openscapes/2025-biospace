Below is a function that does this and returns the result as a xarray\nRecall some files we created earlier: - files_s3 = list; S3 netCDF files directories from the Cape Penisula subset area - files_AVNG_geo = list; coordinates of bounding boxes of the flight line scenes from the Cape Penisula area - class_data_utm = gpd; Cape Penisula Land Types with UTM geography\n\n#the function takes a filepath to a file on s3, and the point locations for extraction\n#this function requires hitting files on the BioSCape SMCE\n\n# def extract_points(s3uri, geof, points):\n#     ds = xr.open_datatree(fs.open(s3uri, 'rb'), decode_coords='all',\n#                           engine='h5netcdf', chunks='auto')\n        \n#     # Clip the raw data to the bounding box  \n#     points = points.clip(geof)\n#     print(f'got {points.shape[0]} point from {s3uri}')\n#     points = points.to_crs(ds.transverse_mercator.crs_wkt)\n    \n        \n#     # Extract points\n#     #extracted = ds.to_dataset().xvec.extract_points(points['geometry'], x_coords=\"easting\", y_coords=\"northing\",index=True)\n#     extracted = ds.reflectance.to_dataset().xvec.extract_points(points['geometry'], \n#                                                                 x_coords=\"easting\", \n#                                                                 y_coords=\"northing\",\n#                                                                 index=True)\n#     return extracted\n\nWhen we call the function, we’ll iterate through the list of files (files_s3). Each file will overlap with several land class points.\n\n# ds_all = [extract_points(file, geo, class_data_utm) for file, geo in zip(files_s3, files_AVNG_geo)]\n# ds_all = xr.concat(ds_all, dim='file')\n\n\n#ds_all\n\nBecause some points are covered by multiple AVIRIS scenes, some points have multiple spectra for each location, and thus we have an extra dim in this. We will simply extract the first valid reflectance measurement for each geometry. We have a custom function to do this get_first_xr()\n\n# ds = get_first_xr(ds_all)\n# ds\n\nThis data set just has the spectra. We need to merge with point data to add labels\n\n# class_xr =class_data_utm[['class','group']].to_xarray()\n# ds = ds.merge(class_xr.astype(int),join='left')\n# ds\n\nWe have defined all the operations we want, but becasue of xarrays lazy compution, the calculations have not yet been done. We will now force it to perform this calculations. We want to keep the result in chunks, so we use .persist() and not .compute(). This should take approx 2 - 3 mins\n\n##  DUE TO RUN TIME LENGTH, WE WILL NOT RUN THIS IN THE WORKSHOP - HAVE SAVED THIS OUTPUT FOR NEXT STEP\n# with ProgressBar():\n# dsp = ds.persist()\n\n\ndsp = xr.open_dataset('dsp.nc')\ndsp\n\n\n\n\nInspect AVIRIS spectra\n\n# recall the class types\nlabel_df\n\n\ndsp_plot = dsp.where(dsp['class']==5, drop=True)\nh = dsp_plot['reflectance'].hvplot.line(x='wavelength',by='index',\n                                    color='green', alpha=0.5,legend=False)\nh\n\n\nAt this point in a real machine learning workflow, you should closely inspect the spectra you have for each class. Do they make sense? Are there some spectra that look weird? You should re-evaluate your data to make sure that the assigned labels are true. This is a very important step\n\n\nPrep data for ML model\nAs you will know, not all of the wavelengths in the data are of equal quality, some will be degraded by atmospheric water absorption features or other factors. We should remove the bands from the analysis that we are not confident of. Probably the best way to do this is to use the uncertainties provided along with the reflectance files. We will simply use some prior knowledge to screen out the worst bands.\n\nwavelengths_to_drop = dsp.wavelength.where(\n    (dsp.wavelength &lt; 450) |\n    (dsp.wavelength &gt;= 1340) & (dsp.wavelength &lt;= 1480) |\n    (dsp.wavelength &gt;= 1800) & (dsp.wavelength &lt;= 1980) |\n    (dsp.wavelength &gt; 2400), drop=True\n)\n\n# Use drop_sel() to remove those specific wavelength ranges\ndsp = dsp.drop_sel(wavelength=wavelengths_to_drop)\n\nmask = (dsp['reflectance'] &gt; -1).all(dim='wavelength')  # Create a mask where all values along 'z' are non-negative\ndsp = dsp.sel(index=mask)\ndsp\n\nNext we will normalize the data, there are a number of difference normalizations to try. In a ML workflow you should try a few and see which work best. We will only use a Brightness Normalization. In essence, we scale the reflectance of each wavelength by the total brightness of the spectra. This retains info on important shape features and relative reflectance, and removes info on absolute reflectance.\n\n# Calculate the L2 norm along the 'wavelength' dimension\nl2_norm = np.sqrt((dsp['reflectance'] ** 2).sum(dim='wavelength'))\n\n# Normalize the reflectance by dividing by the L2 norm\ndsp['reflectance'] = dsp['reflectance'] / l2_norm\n\nPlot the new, clean spectra\n\ndsp_norm_plot = dsp.where(dsp['class']==5, drop=True)\nh = dsp_norm_plot['reflectance'].hvplot.line(x='wavelength',by='index',\n                                         color='green',ylim=(-0.01,0.2),alpha=0.5,legend=False)\nh\n\n\n\n\nTrain and evaluate the ML model\nWe will be using a model called xgboost. There are many, many different kinds of ML models. xgboost is a class of models called gradient boosted trees, related to random forests. When used for classification, random forests work by creating multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data and features, and then averaging their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Gradient boosted trees differ in that they build trees sequentially, with each new tree focusing on correcting the errors of the previous ones. This sequential approach allows xgboost to create highly accurate models by iteratively refining predictions and addressing the weaknesses of earlier trees.\nImport the Machine Learning libraries we will use.\n\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score, confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay\n\nOur dataset has a label indicating which set (training or test), our data belong to. We wil use this to split it\n\n# recall groups\nclass_data_utm.groupby(['group']).size()\n\n\nclass_data_utm.crs\n\n\ndtrain = dsp.where(dsp['group']==1,drop=True)\ndtest = dsp.where(dsp['group']==2,drop=True)\n\n#create separte datasets for labels and features\ny_train = dtrain['class'].values.astype(int)\ny_test = dtest['class'].values.astype(int)\nX_train = dtrain['reflectance'].values\nX_test = dtest['reflectance'].values\n\n\nTrain ML model\nThe steps we will go through to train the model are:\nFirst, we define the hyperparameter grid. Initially, we set up a comprehensive grid (param_grid) with multiple values for several hyperparameters of the XGBoost model.\nNext, we create an XGBoost classifier object using the XGBClassifier class from the XGBoost library.\nWe then set up the GridSearchCV object using our defined XGBoost model and the hyperparameter grid. GridSearchCV allows us to perform an exhaustive search over the specified hyperparameter values to find the optimal combination that results in the best model performance. We choose a 5-fold cross-validation strategy (cv=5), meaning we split our training data into five subsets to validate the model’s performance across different data splits. We use accuracy as our scoring metric to evaluate the models.\nAfter setting up the grid search, we fit the GridSearchCV object to our training data (X_train and y_train). This process involves training multiple models with different hyperparameter combinations and evaluating their performance using cross-validation. Our goal is to identify the set of hyperparameters that yields the highest accuracy.\nOnce the grid search completes, we print out the best set of hyperparameters and the corresponding best score. The grid_search.best_params_ attribute provides the combination of hyperparameters that achieved the highest cross-validation accuracy, while the grid_search.best_score_ attribute shows the corresponding accuracy score. Finally, we extract the best model (best_model) from the grid search results. This model is trained with the optimal hyperparameters and is ready for making predictions or further analysis in our classification task.\nThis will take approx 30 seconds\n\n# Define the hyperparameter grid\nparam_grid = {\n    'max_depth': [5],\n    'learning_rate': [0.1],\n    'subsample': [0.75],\n    'n_estimators' : [50,100]\n}\n\n# Create the XGBoost model object\nxgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier(tree_method='hist')\n\n# Create the GridSearchCV object\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(xgb_model, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')\n\n# Fit the GridSearchCV object to the training data\ngrid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Print the best set of hyperparameters and the corresponding score\nprint(\"Best set of hyperparameters: \", grid_search.best_params_)\nprint(\"Best score: \", grid_search.best_score_)\nbest_model = grid_search.best_estimator_\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate model performance\nWe will use our best model to predict the classes of the test data Then, we calculate the F1 score using f1_score, which balances precision and recall, and print it to evaluate overall performance.\nNext, we assess how well the model performs for predicting Pine trees by calculating its precision and recall. Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions. It answers the question, “Of all the instances we labeled as Pines, how many were actually Pines?”. Recall measures the model’s ability to identify all actual positive instances. It answers the question, “Of all the actual Pines, how many did we correctly identify?”. You may also be familiar with the terms Users’ and Producers’ Accuracy. Precision = User’ Accuracy, and Recall = Producers’ Accuracy.\nFinally, we create and display a confusion matrix to visualize the model’s prediction accuracy across all classes\n\ny_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate acc and F1 score for the entire dataset\nacc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {acc}\")\n\nf1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')  # 'weighted' accounts for class imbalance\nprint(f\"F1 Score (weighted): {f1}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate precision and recall for class 5 (Pine)\nprecision_class_5 = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, labels=[5], average='macro', zero_division=0)\nrecall_class_5 = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, labels=[5], average='macro', zero_division=0)\n\nprint(f\"Precision for Class 5: {precision_class_5}\")\nprint(f\"Recall for Class 5: {recall_class_5}\")\n\n# Step 4: Plot the confusion matrix\nconf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\n\nConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=conf_matrix).plot()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nSkipping Some steps in Glenn’s BioSCape Workshop Tutorial\n8.2.1.8. Interpret and understand ML model\nhttps://ornldaac.github.io/bioscape_workshop_sa/tutorials/Machine_Learning/Invasive_AVIRIS.html#interpret-and-understand-ml-model\n\n\nPredict over an example AVIRIS scene\nWe now have a trained model and are ready to deploy it to generate predictions across an entire AVIRIS scene and map the distribution of invasive plants. This involves handling a large volume of data, so we need to write the code to do this intelligently. We will accomplish this by applying the .predict() method of our trained model in parallel across the chunks of the AVIRIS xarray. The model will receive one chunk at a time so that the data is not too large, but it will be able to perform this operation in parallel across multiple chunks, and therefore will not take too long.\nThis model was only trained on data covering natural vegetaton in the Cape Peninsula, It is important that we only predict in the areas that match our training data. We will therefore filter to scenes that cover the Cape Peninsula and mask out non-protected areas\n\n#south africa protected areas\nSAPAD = (gpd.read_file('data/SAPAD_2024.gpkg')\n         .query(\"SITE_TYPE!='Marine Protected Area'\")\n        )\n#SAPAD.plot()\n#SAPAD.to_crs(\"EPSG:32734\")\nSAPAD.crs\n\n\n# Get the bounding box of the training data\nbbox = class_data_utm.total_bounds  # (minx, miny, maxx, maxy)\n#bbox\ngdf_bbox = gpd.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': [box(*bbox)]}, crs=class_data_utm.crs)  # Specify the CRS\ngdf_bbox['geometry'] = gdf_bbox.buffer(500)\ngdf_bbox.crs\n\n\n#south africa protected areas\nSAPAD = (gpd.read_file('data/SAPAD_2024.gpkg')\n         .query(\"SITE_TYPE!='Marine Protected Area'\")\n        )\nSAPAD = SAPAD.to_crs(\"EPSG:32734\")\n\n# Get the bounding box of the training data\nbbox = class_data_utm.total_bounds  # (minx, miny, maxx, maxy)\ngdf_bbox = gpd.GeoDataFrame({'geometry': [box(*bbox)]}, crs=class_data_utm.crs)  # Specify the CRS\ngdf_bbox['geometry'] = gdf_bbox.buffer(500)\n\n# protected areas that intersect with the training data\nSAPAD_CT = SAPAD.overlay(gdf_bbox,how='intersection')\n\n#keep only AVIRIS scenes that intersects with CT protected areas\nAVNG_sapad = AVNG_CP[AVNG_CP.intersects(SAPAD_CT.unary_union)]\n\n#a list of files to predict\nfiles_sapad = AVNG_sapad['RFL s3'].tolist()\n\n#how many files?\nlen(files_sapad)\n\n\nm = AVNG_sapad[['fid','geometry']].explore('fid')\nm\n\n\nSAPAD.keys()\n\n\n#map = AVNG_Coverage[['fid', 'geometry']].explore('fid')\nmap = SAPAD[['SITE_TYPE', 'geometry']].explore('SITE_TYPE')\nmap\n\nHere is the function that we will actually apply to each chunk. Simple really. The hard work is getting the data into and out of this functiON\n\ndef predict_on_chunk(chunk, model):\n    probabilities = model.predict_proba(chunk)\n    return probabilities\n\nNow we define the funciton that takes as input the path to the AVIRIS file and pass the data to the predict function. THhs is composed of 4 parts:\nPart 1: Opens the AVIRIS data file using xarray and sets a condition to identify valid data points where reflectance values are greater than zero.\nPart 2: Applies all the transformations that need to be done before the data goes to the model. It the spatial dimensions (x and y) into a single dimension, filters wavelengths, and normalizes the reflectance data.\nPart 3: Applies the machine learning model to the normalized data in parallel, predicting class probabilities for each data point using xarray’s apply_ufunc method. Most of the function invloves defining what to do with the dimensions of the old dataset and the new output\nPart 4: Unstacks the data to restore its original dimensions, sets spatial dimensions and coordinate reference system (CRS), clips the data, and transposes the data to match expected formats before returning the results.\n\ndef predict_xr(file,geometries):\n\n    #part 1 - opening file\n    #open the file\n    print(f'file: {file}')\n    ds = xr.open_datatree(rfl_netcdf_2i2c, engine='h5netcdf', decode_coords=\"all\",\n                         chunks='auto')\n\n    #get the geometries of the protected areas for masking\n    ds_crs = ds.transverse_mercator.crs_wkt\n    geometries = geometries.to_crs(ds_crs).geometry.apply(mapping)\n\n    #condition to use for masking no data later\n    condition = (ds['reflectance'] &gt; -1).any(dim='wavelength')\n\n    #stack the data into a single dimension. This will be important for applying the model later\n    ds = ds.reflectance.to_dataset().stack(sample=('easting','northing'))\n    \n    #part 2 - pre-processing\n    #remove bad wavelenghts\n    wavelengths_to_drop = ds.wavelength.where(\n        (ds.wavelength &lt; 450) |\n        (ds.wavelength &gt;= 1340) & (ds.wavelength &lt;= 1480) |\n        (ds.wavelength &gt;= 1800) & (ds.wavelength &lt;= 1980) |\n        (ds.wavelength &gt; 2400), drop=True\n    )\n    # Use drop_sel() to remove those specific wavelength ranges\n    ds = ds.drop_sel(wavelength=wavelengths_to_drop)\n    \n    #normalise the data\n    l2_norm = np.sqrt((ds['reflectance'] ** 2).sum(dim='wavelength'))\n    ds['reflectance'] = ds['reflectance'] / l2_norm\n\n     \n    #part 3 - apply the model over chunks\n    result = xr.apply_ufunc(\n        predict_on_chunk,\n        ds['reflectance'].chunk(dict(wavelength=-1)),\n        input_core_dims=[['wavelength']],#input dim with features\n        output_core_dims=[['class']],  # name for the new output dim\n        exclude_dims=set(('wavelength',)),  #dims to drop in result\n        output_sizes={'class': 9}, #length of the new dimension\n        output_dtypes=[np.float32],\n        dask=\"parallelized\",\n        kwargs={'model': best_model}\n    )\n\n    #part 4 - post-processing\n    result = result.where((result &gt;= 0) & (result &lt;= 1), np.nan) #valid values\n    result = result.unstack('sample') #remove the stack\n    result = result.rio.set_spatial_dims(x_dim='easting',y_dim='northing') #set the spatial dims\n    result = result.rio.write_crs(ds_crs) #set the CRS\n    result = result.rio.clip(geometries) #clip to the protected areas and no data\n    result = result.transpose('class', 'northing', 'easting') #transpose the data rio expects it this way\n    return result   \n\nLet’s test that it works on a single file before we run it through 100s of GB of data.\n\n#files_sapad[25]\n\n\ntest  = predict_xr(rfl_netcdf_2i2c,SAPAD_CT)\ntest\n\n\nlabel_df\n\n\ntest = test.rio.reproject(\"EPSG:4326\",nodata=np.nan)\nh = test.isel({'class':5}).hvplot(tiles=hv.element.tiles.EsriImagery(), \n                              project=True,rasterize=True,clim=(0,1),\n                              cmap='magma',frame_width=400,data_aspect=1,alpha=0.5)\nh\n\nML models typically provide a single prediction of the most likely outcomes. You can also get probability-like scores (values from 0 to 1) from these models, but they are not true probabilities. If the model gives you a score of 0.6, that means it is more likely than a prediction of 0.5, and less likely than 0.7. However, it does not mean that in a large sample your prediction would be right 60 times out of 100. To get calibrated probabilities from our models, we have to apply additional steps. We can also get a set of predictions from models rather than a single prediction, which reflects the model’s true uncertainty using a technique called conformal predictions.

Uncertainty quantification for probabilistic machine learning in earth observation using conformal prediction. Scientific Reports, 14(1), 16166.\n\n\nFinal steps of the full ML classification are time intensive and are not described in this workshop.\nSteps in Glenn Moncrieff’s BioSCape Workshop Tutorial\n8.2.1.10.

From 4 airborne instruments (Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG), Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM), Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES), and Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS)) the BioSCape Campaign’s remote sensing data products provides an unprecedented level of image spectroscopy from VSWIR to TIR wavelengths as well as full-waveform laser altimeter measurements. Airborne data are supplemented with a rich combination of contemporaneous biodiversity-relevant field observations toward an approach to measure and understand functional, phylogenetic, and taxonomic biological diversity as components of ecosystem function.\nA majority of the BioSCape Campaign data will be archived through the NASA-funded Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC). The discipline-specific Center provides dataset content to NASA’s Earthdata Cloud which includes a standardized metadata called Common Metadata Repository (CMR), data discovery, and open access.\nThis hands-on demonstration will leverage a managed cloud environment to show programmatic discovery, access, and analysis of NASA BioSCape data/resources and concurrent orbital data. Included will be content and tutorials demonstrating derivation of estimates of biodiversity variables including:\n\nAn overview of the BioSCape Campaign data acquisition\nNASA Earthdata Cloud: Search, Access, and Analysis Basics\nExplore BioSCape vegetation plot and image spectroscopy data\nInvasive species analysis from AVIRIS-NG and Vegetation Plot Data\nVegetation Structural Diversity derived from LVIS and GEDI full waveform lidar data.\nAquatic biodiversity estimates from PRISM, PACE, and EMIT\n\nGET STARTED:\n\nDeploy Jupyter Lab instance in 2i2c\n\nAccess notebooks without cloning",
